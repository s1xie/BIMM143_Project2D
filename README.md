Scientific Question: How similar is the d-limonene protein found in the aroma of lemons compared to the d-limonene protein in the aroma of sweet oranges?

Pairwise sequence alignment was performed between the d-limonene synthase protein in Citrus limon and Citrus sinensis to determine whether thereâ€™s an 80% or more similarity between the two sequences. Multiple pairwise alignment was performed between Citrus limon and 5 other citrus fruits; Citrus sinensis, Citrus unshiu, Citrus jambhiri, Citrus japonica, and Citrus trifoliata.  Heat map analysis and a hierarchal tree plot was used to provide a visual analysis of the similarity and dissimilarity and the relationship between the limonene synthase sequence in different Citrus fruits.  

The FASTA files needed are: 
Citrus limon:  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/protein/AAM53946.1?report=fasta
Citrus sinensis: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/protein/AOP12358.2?report=fasta
Citrus unshiu: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/protein/BAD27257.1?report=fasta
Citrus trifoliata: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/protein/BAG74774.1?report=fasta
Citrus jambhiri: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/protein/BAF73932.1?report=fasta
Citrus japonica: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/protein/QBK56505.1?report=fasta

To find these files, I went on the NCBI database and searched for limonene citrus in the protein database and downloaded the files as FASTA format.
